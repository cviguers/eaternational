## Description

This is an HTML and JavaScript code that creates an app that allows users to search and buy international snacks. It provides a user interface with navigation, snack features, and regional searches to help to user find products. the tool uses mySQL, Node and Express to populate and navigate to inventory databases on our home server. Then the tables are populated into the viewport with handlebars.

## Getting started

The tool relies on mySQL, Node and Express, handlebars and various other npms for its functionality. In the current implementation, the shopping cart feature is not fully functional. We plan to implement that in the further patch. 

## Usage

To use the tool, simply open this link in your browser of choice!
